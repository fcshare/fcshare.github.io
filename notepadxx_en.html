        <p>Xiaoxiao Notepad is a simple software just like Microsoft Notepad where you can record anything starting from phone number, website link and other important information quickly. This is actually a text editing software that works under windows 2000/2003/2008/2012/XP/Vista/7/8/10. The interface is very simple and you can start using it the moment you get it in your hand. This software is completely free.</p>

<p>This notepad contains an index page and this page opens up each time you launch this software. The index page displays all the recently opened files along with their details such as file names, last access time, file size and the one or two line content of the files. The details especially the content makes it easy for you to find out the files you are looking for. The file names are shown with hyperlink and a click on that link will open up the file.</p>

<p>When you are searching for a specific word in the Xiaoxiao Notepad, always try searching it in the index page. First all the recently opened files will be checked one by one and the results found will be reflected under the name of each file. If the process is continued, you will get the next result and once the searching process is over in one file, you can search the next file to find out the word.</p>

<p>When it comes to editing the text in this software, Xiaoxiao Notepad has its own characteristic that is different from others. Editing, saving, viewing etc. are the basic features in this notepad besides which it also displays images. Inserting an image is as simple as that where you just need to drag a picture from the explorer and then drop it in the notepad. Thatâ€™s it. Also adding the charts, formulas and pictures in the text can be easily done with this notepad style software.</p>

<p>This is the most interesting feature of this tool where you do not have to save anything. A newly created file is never required to be saved using a path and providing a file name in this notepad. But do not worry as the created file will not be lost and next time you launch it, everything will be available the way it was written or edited. Also you can close a file in the mid of editing or switch to another file without saving the file. Closing the file without saving the modification will not be lost and next time you open the file, you can continue editing as before.</p>

<p>Hope you have liked the product and we are on the way to present more software before you. But do not forget to recommend this software to your friends, please follow us on twitter, facebook, github and in other social networking sites.</p>
